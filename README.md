# Water quality prediction


Water quality is essential for human health, agriculture, and the environment. However, factors like pollution, climate change, and industrial activities can impact water quality, making it difficult to predict and manage effectively. In this project, we use historical water quality data to predict future water quality levels, allowing for proactive management and ensuring safer water for communities.
